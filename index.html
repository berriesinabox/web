<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;line-height: 40px;margin-bottom: 50px;">Hi, Iâ€™m Shivi, a first-year electrical engineering student at NIT Silchar with a deep love for photography, videography, and creative storytelling. While I navigate the world of circuits and equations, I find my true escape behind the lensâ€”where I can freeze fleeting moments, capture emotions, and turn everyday scenes into something extraordinary.

Engineering, especially physics, challenges me, but I embrace it as part of my journey. Beyond academics, I immerse myself in creativity, whether itâ€™s capturing the golden hues of a sunset, the quiet beauty of a candid moment, or the raw energy of an event. Photography and videography arenâ€™t just hobbies for meâ€”they are my way of preserving time, telling stories, and sharing my perspective with the world. Every shot I take, every frame I compose, is a piece of my vision, a reflection of how I see and experience life.

Apart from my love for visuals, I actively contribute to college events, from designing fest decorations to participating in NSS activities that allow me to give back to the community. I love being part of experiences that bring people together, whether through my involvement in creative projects or by capturing moments that people will cherish forever.

While I sometimes push myself too hard, I believe in continuous growthâ€”both as a student and as a creator. This space is my journey in motion, where engineering meets art, logic meets creativity, and every captured moment becomes a story worth telling.

Welcome to my worldâ€”where learning, exploration, and storytelling come together, one frame at a time. ðŸ“¸ðŸŽ¥âœ¨</p>
